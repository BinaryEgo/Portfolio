# Portfolio
A web application built with Flask and deployed with Heroku. It serves as an extension of my resume and
a showcase of projects I have worked on.

The web application is hosted here: https://jermy-portfolio.herokuapp.com/.

Currently, I have included Excel projects I have worked on because — in my experience — mastering Excel
helped me ease into learning programming languages. I taught myself Python and SQL, but 
I expect this portfolio to evolve as 1. I learn new technologies and 2. I get more hands-on experience.

### Questions
I had originally built the routes into a separate routes.py. I then imported these routes into the 
__init__.py — rather than have them all listed in the same file. This worked locally, but when I launched 
to Heroku, it failed.

I'm still puzzled by this, so if you'd like to talk about that — or how to better structure my code — 
let me know! I aim for my code to be readable and efficient, and appreciate any help I can get!
