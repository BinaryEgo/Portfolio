            <p>My name is Jermy – or "Jerm" for short. I enjoy creating things,
                whether that be
                on paper or for the web. After over 5 years of building dynamic data models with
                <strong>Excel</strong>
                for my previous employer, I was inspired to <em>"level up"</em> – to step further into the world of
                tech!
                <br>
                <br>
                I built and designed this website to showcase what I have learned.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that I have added <strong>HTML,
                    CSS,
                    Python </strong>
                and <strong>SQL</strong> to my tool box, and I am excited to both put my skills to work and to
                strengthen
                my web & software development skills.
